# LD48.Claustrophobia

![Claustrophobia](./sources/game/assets/images/splash-160x144@2x.png)

Welcome ! [Claustrophobia](https://deformhead.github.io/LD48.Claustrophobia/index.html) ([Ludum Dare 42 Theme: Running out of space](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/42/ld48-claustrophobia)) is built in plain HTML5/JavaScript with a framework I am developping.

I'd like to :

- add sfx (with a "buzzz" increasing when the noisy shadow shrinks)
- add explosion effects when a bomb hits the player
- add some monologues in each level to add real depth to the chlaustrophobic effect
- add much more levels

This was my first Game Jam, so I hope you'll like this game. Thank you for your support.
